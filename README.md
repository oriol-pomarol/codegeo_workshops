# CodeGEO Workshops: Practical Insights on ML for Geoscientists

The CodeGEO Workshops have been created by the DPG Coding/ML group (Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University), to provide an easy way into machine learning for our colleagues and fellow geoscientists elsewhere.

## Description

In these workshops, a machine learning related topic is introduced and exemplified through a Python Notebook. The notebooks are ordered by date of publication, but are meant to be stand-alone and last about 1h. They also contain exercises in which one can put to practice the concepts learnt, and start learning ML from hands-on experience!

For UU email account holders, we encourage you to join the DPG Coding/ML Teams group (see [Contact](#contact) section), where you can find presentations with additional contents and recordings for these workshops. There you can also stay up to date with our activities and keep in touch with our wonderful community.

## Installation

The recommended way of going through the notebooks is by using Google Collab. You can find a link at the top of each notebook that will automatically take you there. Before running the notebook, you will be asked to sign in with your Google account and go through a Warning (select "Run anyway" to skip). After that, you can run, change and play with the code as much as you want!

### Locally running the notebook

If you still prefer to run the notebooks locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), or your preferred conda distribution.

2. Download the *environment.yml* file from this repository. 

3. Create the conda environment from the Anaconda prompt at your fileâ€™s location.
```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the environment.
```bash
    conda activate codegeo_workshop
````

4. Start Jupyter notebook, or your preferred choice for reading .ipynb files. From there, you can select your file and start learning!
